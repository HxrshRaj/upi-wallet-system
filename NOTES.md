# Project Notes

This project was intentionally designed as a learning system rather than a production-ready wallet.

The focus was on:
- understanding system behavior
- reasoning about design decisions
- documenting trade-offs clearly

Future improvements would involve deeper backend simulation and richer user feedback mechanisms.
